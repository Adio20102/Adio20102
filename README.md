# Hey there, I'm Aditya Joshi! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a **Cybersecurity Enthusiast** and recent B.Tech graduate (specializing in Cybersecurity & Digital Forensics) from Vellore Institute of Technology. Passionate about protecting digital assets through hands-on tools like IBM Guardium, penetration testing, and building secure apps. When I'm not hacking (ethically!), I'm geeking out over anime or shooting hoops.

## 🔒 About Me
- 🌱 Currently exploring advanced database security and ethical hacking techniques post-internships.
- 💻 Hands-on with real-world projects in vulnerability assessment, incident response, and Python-based tools.
- 🎯 Goal: Land a role as a Cybersecurity Analyst to build resilient systems and contribute to threat detection innovations.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a die-hard anime fan—*Attack on Titan* and *Your Name* are my ultimate rewatches, and I've got limited Japanese skills to match!

## 🛠️ Skills
- **Languages**: Python, Java, SQL, Bash
- **Technologies**: IBM Guardium, OpenCV, Flask, MySQL, Tkinter
- **Areas of Expertise**: Penetration Testing, Vulnerability Assessment, Database Security, Incident Response, Network Security
